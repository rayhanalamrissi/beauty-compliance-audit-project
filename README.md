# 💄 Third-Party Compliance Audit - Beauty Industry

## 📌 Project Overview
As a Data Privacy & Compliance Analyst, I developed this automated risk assessment framework to audit a global ecosystem of 500+ vendors (Raw material suppliers, Marketing agencies, Influencers). 

The tool ensures **Data Integrity** and **Regulatory Compliance** by identifying high-risk partners in real-time.

## 🛠️ Audit Methodology & Logic
I implemented automated verification rules to flag anomalies:

1. **GDPR Privacy Check**: Flags partners processing personal data without a signed **DPA** (Article 28 compliance).
2. **Financial Integrity Check**: Detects mismatches between **HQ Country** and **Bank Country** to prevent fraud and shell company exposure.
3. **Global Status Scoring**: Automatically categorizes vendors as **'COMPLIANT'** or **'CRITICAL'**.

## 🚀 Key Results
* **Audit Population**: 500 Vendors.
* **Compliance Rate**: 95.4% 
* **Critical Risk Detection**: **4.6%** (23 partners identified for immediate remediation).
* **Efficiency**: Reduced audit cycle time from days to seconds through automation.
